# 7 minigame concepts for UEFN/Verse lessons

Here we present concepts for the seven minigames aimed to be used in lessons on customized game mechanics in UEFN/Verse. 

We have been demonstrated an approuch to learning UEFN/Verse in a demo course [Learn to code with Verse and UEFN](https://petljamediastorage.blob.core.windows.net/temp/learn-verse/index.html), but that demo lacks more complete examles that could be used to jums-start into making games.

Minigames we present here are, for the sake of simplicity, implemted on a single plane grid island with teleports from the player spawner location. Final game examples in lessons may upgrade presented cocepts to even more compleate game experiences, but also can be devided into milestones to allow more gradual steps throught lessons.
