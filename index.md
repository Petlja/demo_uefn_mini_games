# 7 minigame concepts for UEFN/Verse lessons

Here we present concepts for the seven minigames designed to be used in lessons on custom game mechanics in UEFN/Verse. 

Previously, we demonstrated an approach to learning UEFN/Verse in a demo course [Learn to code with Verse and UEFN](https://petljamediastorage.blob.core.windows.net/temp/learn-verse/index.html); however, this demo course lacks more complete examples that could help learners jump into game making.

For the sake of simplicity, minigames we present here are implemented  on a single plane grid island with teleports from the player spawner location. Final game examples in lessons may upgrade presented concepts to even more complete game experiences, and they can be divided into milestones to allow more gradual steps through lessons.
