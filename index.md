# 7 minigame concepts for UEFN/Verse lessons

Here we present concepts for the seven minigames suitable for lessons on the implementation of game mechanics in UEFN using Verse. 

We have been demonstrated an approuch to learning UEFN/Verse in a demo course [Learn to code with Verse and UEFN](https://petljamediastorage.blob.core.windows.net/temp/learn-verse/index.html), but that demo lacks more complete examples that could be used to jump right into making a game.

Minigames we present here are, for the sake of simplicity, implemted on a single plane grid island with teleports from the player spawner location. Final game examples in lessons may upgrade presented cocepts to even more compleate game experiences, but also can be devided into milestones to allow more gradual steps throught lessons.
