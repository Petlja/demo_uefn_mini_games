# Welcome to Learn to code with Verse and UEFN!

This course will serve as an introduction to the **Verse** programming language and the implementation of game mechanics in the **Unreal Editor for Fortnite** (UEFN).

In this course, we will first do a run through of a basic island setup, and adding the needed editable objects (called *devices* in UEFN) after which we will jump straight into modifying the behavior of these devices using  the Verse programing language. 

At the start of each section, you will be given a milestone, which is a preview of what the island will look like and how it will behave after you're done following the instructions that are a part of that same section.
